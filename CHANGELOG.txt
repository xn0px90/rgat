09/10/16 0.2 [PREVIOUS SAVES OBSOLETE]
-----------------
The trace generator has had its algorithm completely revamped with a form of 
soft deinstrumentation (see issue #6).

This means that in areas of repeating blocks with no fresh code, drgat stops recording 
exact trace data, ensuring that only target branches and execution counts are recorded.
In many circumstances this is an improvement of an order of magnitude over the previous algorithm
and makes rgat usable for many applications that would previously have filled the 
trace buffer.

Unfortunately it no longer provides an exact log of every instruction in order. Replay is currently disabled,
but will return in a more fuzzy 'busy areas' format in future 0.2.* updates (instead of the 
previous exact instruction replay). Divergence is also disabled and will return soon.

This change also meant that creating the heatmap is a lot less straightforward. rgat now uses a network flow
solver to calculate the weight of all of the edges, and displays instruction execution counts (in white) as 
well as the edge weights. An unexpected benefit is that it if there are any errors in the graph,
the solver will detect it and complain. This has uncovered a significant number of errors in trace 
generation and graph construction which have now been fixed.

Various crashes have been fixed.
